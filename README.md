# Drink8CupsofWater

Sixty percent of adults are made up of water, so we need to consume water every day.
The body's daily breathing cycle, digestion, absorption, excretion, exercise, etc. will consume the body's water.
So 8 glasses of water a day is a good starting point for healthy living and keeping water.
